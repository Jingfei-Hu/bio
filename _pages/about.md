## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Texas Tech University in the Department of Plant & Soil Science.

My research integrates plant-microbiome interactions, soil biogeochemistry, and multi-omics approaches to understand how symbiotic fungi enhance plant resilience under environmental stress.

I develop computational and bioinformatic frameworks for microbiome analysis, including MicroFisher, a multi-marker fungal classification tool for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets.

## Research Vision

My long-term goal is to lead interdisciplinary research that translates mechanistic microbiome insights into sustainable agricultural and forest ecosystem management.
